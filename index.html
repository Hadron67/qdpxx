        <p>The QDP++ interface provides a data-parallel programming environment suitable for Lattice QCD where operations in operator/infix form can be applied on lattice wide objects. The interface provides a level of abstraction such that high-level user code written above the interface can be run unchanged on a single processor workstation or a collection of multiprocessor nodes with parallel communications. Architectural dependencies are hidden below the interface. A variety of types for the site elements are provided. To achieve good performance, overlapping communication and computation primitives are provided.</p>

<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>In order to build QDP++ you will need</p>

<ul>
<li>to have the libxml2 development library installed. If you don't have this, and don't have a package for your OS, you can build it from this copy of the source or you can try downloading it from The LibXML web page On a QCDOC a hacked version is needed, the source for which is here. On Linux and Cygwin Systems there is a package for libxml2. On RedHat systems it is called "libxml2-devel".</li>
<li>if you want to work on a parallel machine, you will need to have the QMP Message Passing Harness installed. The current version of the source for QMP is <a href="https://github.com/usqcd-software/qmp">QMP</a>
</li>
<li>if you want to work on the BlueGene you may want some of the optimizations from bagel_qdp  (link here). For this you will also need the BAGEL assembler generator package from Peter Boyle and agree to all his requests on his web page.</li>

<a name="documentation-and-user-information" class="anchor" href="#documentation-and-user-information"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation and User Information</h2>

<p>Here is the current <a href="http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/manual.pdf">pdf</a> version of the manual, and there is also an <a href="http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/manual/index.html">html</a> version. There is documentation produced by doxygen. A <a href="http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/usr/html/index.html">user guide</a> is also available.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/658088">paper</a> that describes QDP++ as well as the <a href="https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma">Chroma</a> that uses it. Please cite (at least) this paper in publications that use the code.</p>
