{"name":"Qdpxx","tagline":"QDP++ (LQCD) The QDP++ Framework for Lattice QCD","body":"# QDP++\r\n\r\nThe QDP++ interface provides a data-parallel programming environment suitable for Lattice QCD where operations in operator/infix form can be applied on lattice wide objects. The interface provides a level of abstraction such that high-level user code written above the interface can be run unchanged on a single processor workstation or a collection of multiprocessor nodes with parallel communications. Architectural dependencies are hidden below the interface. A variety of types for the site elements are provided. To achieve good performance, overlapping communication and computation primitives are provided.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nIn order to build QDP++ you will need\r\n* to have the libxml2 development library installed. If you don't have this, and don't have a package for your OS, you can build it from this copy of the source or you can try downloading it from The LibXML web page On a QCDOC a hacked version is needed, the source for which is here. On Linux and Cygwin Systems there is a package for libxml2. On RedHat systems it is called \"libxml2-devel\".\r\n* if you want to work on a parallel machine, you will need to have the QMP Message Passing Harness installed. The current version of the source for QMP is [QMP](https://github.com/usqcd-software/qmp)\r\n* if you want to work on the BlueGene you may want some of the optimizations from bagel_qdp  (link here). For this you will also need the BAGEL assembler generator package from Peter Boyle and agree to all his requests on his web page.\r\n\r\n## Documentation and User Information\r\nHere is the current [pdf](http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/manual.pdf) version of the manual, and there is also an [html](http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/manual/index.html) version. There is documentation produced by doxygen. A [user guide](http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qdp++/usr/html/index.html) is also available.\r\n\r\n## References\r\nThere is a [paper](http://inspirehep.net/record/658088) that describes QDP++ as well as the [Chroma](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma) that uses it. Please cite (at least) this paper in publications that use the code.\r\n\r\n## Developer Information\r\nThe motivation for this development comes from the U.S. Dept. of Energy [SciDAC](http://www.scidac.gov) program. See the [USQCD](http://www.usqcd.org) home pages for more details.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
